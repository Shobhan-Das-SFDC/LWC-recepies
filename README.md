# LWC-recepies
LWC Practice Snippets 

LWC Notes --->

#1 Since JS is case sensitive, if you are using a @wire service and query field data using SOQL, ensure the fieldName in JS file matches (Case wise) with that API name of the SOQL

#2 If you are using Apex controller and passing parameters from LWC to Apex method, ensure the parameter/arguement name is same is in both LWC & Apex
